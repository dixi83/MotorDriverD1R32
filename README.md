# MotorDriverD1R32

Library for Arduino Motor Driver V1 plugged on a Wemos D1 DR32 board.

2022-12-28: Modified by Martijn Diks to work with the Wemos D1 R32 board. 

Though The Old Adafruit Motor Shield has been discontinued, a lot of Chinese sellers continue to manufacture this Shield at a low cost, and it is a good Shield for running a small robotics class. This library allows you to access and control all motor channels
